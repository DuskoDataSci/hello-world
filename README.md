# hello-world
In this repository you can find my current ideas and things I will be working on in the upcoming weeks. 

<b>Short introduction</b>: 

My name is Dusko and I am a student of both Business Economics and Data Science. I've joined the community of Github primarily so I can sharpen up my coding skills and grow as a data scientist. I'm still very green in this field and have a lot to learn, but I am planning to get the most out of this opportunity. 

Recommendations for studymaterial or awesome projects I should check out, are greatly appreciated !
Thank you for having me here and I hope to talk to you soon :D. 


<b>Projects I will be working on</b>:
